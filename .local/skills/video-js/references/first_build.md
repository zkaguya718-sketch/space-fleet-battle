<first_build>
When building a new animated video for the first time, follow this exact sequence. Do not deviate.

## What the scaffold provides

These files are already opened in your context after `createArtifact()` returns. Do NOT re-read them:

- `src/components/video/VideoTemplate.tsx` -- template with placeholder ReplitLoadingScene, `useVideoPlayer` hook wired up
- `src/lib/video/hooks.ts` -- `useVideoPlayer` and `useSceneTimer` hooks (DO NOT MODIFY -- recording/export depends on exact implementation)
- `src/lib/video/animations.ts` -- 40+ animation presets (springs, easings, scene transitions, element animations, kinetic typography variants)
- `src/lib/video/index.ts` -- barrel export of hooks and animations
- `src/index.css` -- Tailwind imports + CSS variables for colors and fonts (subagent will customize)
- `index.html` -- HTML shell with Google Fonts preloaded
- `src/main.tsx` -- React entry point

Pre-installed packages (do NOT install these): `framer-motion`, `gsap`, `@react-spring/web`, `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, `lucide-react`, `tailwindcss`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `lottie-react`.

## Build sequence

Execute these 4 steps in order. No additional steps.

### Step 1: Delegate to DESIGN subagent

Call `subagent()` (synchronous -- blocks until complete). Pass the user's request exactly as-is, prefixed with the skill reference. Do NOT add creative direction, color guidance, typography choices, or any other prescriptive instructions.

```javascript
const result = await subagent({
    task: `You are the subagent executing this task, see the skill: .local/skills/video-js/SKILL.md\n\n${userRequest}`,
    specialization: "DESIGN",
    relevantFiles: [".local/skills/video-js/SKILL.md", ".local/skills/video-js/references/finalize_playback.md"]
});
```

The design subagent handles everything: creative direction, asset generation (images, video clips, stock photos), scene building, CSS theming, validation (`validate-recording.sh`), and finalization (frame containment, loop integrity). You do not verify or fix its output.

### Step 2: Restart the workflow

```javascript
await restart_workflow({ name: "artifacts/<slug>: web" });
```

### Step 3: Check logs for errors

```javascript
await refresh_all_logs();
```

Read the workflow logs. If there are build errors (missing imports, syntax errors, etc.), fix them and restart the workflow again. If the logs are clean, proceed to step 4.

### Step 4: Present the artifact

```javascript
await presentArtifact({ artifactId: result.artifactId });
```

## First build rules

- Do NOT read any files before or after delegation -- scaffold files are documented above, and the subagent's output does not need verification.
- Do NOT add your own creative direction, style instructions, color guidance, or typography choices to the subagent task. The design subagent is the creative expert -- let it make all decisions.
- Do NOT use `startAsyncSubagent` -- use synchronous `subagent()` so you block until it's done.
- Do NOT restart the workflow before the design subagent completes.
- Do NOT take screenshots during the build.
- Do NOT call `suggestDeploy()` -- video artifacts are not deployable. They are exported from the preview pane.
- Do NOT delegate finalization separately -- the design subagent handles it per `<completing_your_run>` in the skill.
- There is no need to test or code review the first build.
